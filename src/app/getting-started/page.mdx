# Getting Started

To style profiles, you need to target specific classes and IDs provided by Kreatiko's profile structure. The platform uses a modular CSS approach, allowing you to override default styles or add new ones.

## Basic Structure

Kreatiko's profile structure is organized into several key elements:

- `#block`: containers of profile elements
- `.text`: every text element (including links)
- `img`: every image element
- `button`: every button element
- `a`: every link element

### Blocks

Each block has their own block type in html div for example:

if you want to style every block you can use the following selector:

```css
#block {
  background-color: red;
}
```

if you want to style a specific block you can use the following selector:

```css
#block[data-block="profile"] {
  background-color: red;
}
```

### Text

Text is the main text element in the profile.

```css
.text {
  color: red;
}
```
